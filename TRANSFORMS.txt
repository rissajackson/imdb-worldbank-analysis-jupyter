Cast errors:

% select cast(date_of_birth as date) as date_of_birth from imdb_modeled.Actors
REASON: Some of the date_of_birth entries are just the year so big query is unable to cast them as date as it expects it in the format year-month-day. The same error for imdb_modeled.Directors and imdb_modeled.Writers also has the same case.

% select cast(usa_gross_income as INT64) as usa_gross_income
from imdb_modeled.Movies
REASON: The $ comes up as an error when trying to cast the usa_gross_income as an integer, because big query does not expect the $ symbol. 

% select cast(worlwide_gross_income as INT64) as worlwide_gross_income
from imdb_modeled.Movies

% select cast(date_of_death as date) as date_of_death
